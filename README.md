# Tic-Tac-Toe-game-in-c-language
This C project is a simple Tic-Tac-Toe game where the user (X) plays against the computer (O) on a 3x3 grid. It features dynamic board updates, win/draw detection, and a replay option. The program uses 2D arrays, functions, and random number generation for gameplay. Itâ€™s a great example of implementing basic game logic in C.
